# Adopt-a-Dog Finder

A lightweight, interactive dog adoption website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can browse random dogs using the Dog CEO API, like their favorites, submit their own dogs for adoption, and even adopt (remove) dogs — all in a sleek, user-friendly interface.

## Features
